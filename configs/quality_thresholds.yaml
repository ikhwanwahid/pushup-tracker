# Quality assessment thresholds for push-up scoring
scoring:
  weights:
    back_alignment: 0.4
    depth: 0.35
    extension: 0.25

  # Back alignment: ideal is 180 degrees
  back_alignment:
    ideal_angle: 180.0
    max_deviation: 45.0  # degrees; beyond this = score 0

  # Depth: minimum elbow angle at bottom position
  depth:
    good_angle: 90.0      # degrees or less = score 100
    poor_angle: 160.0     # degrees or more = score 0

  # Extension: maximum elbow angle at top position
  extension:
    good_angle: 170.0     # degrees or more = score 100
    poor_angle: 120.0     # degrees or less = score 0

# State machine thresholds for rep counting
counting:
  down_threshold: 90.0    # elbow angle to trigger DOWN state
  up_threshold: 160.0     # elbow angle to trigger UP state

# Confidence thresholds
detection:
  min_confidence: 0.3     # minimum keypoint confidence to draw/use
  min_visible_joints: 8   # minimum visible unified joints for valid frame
